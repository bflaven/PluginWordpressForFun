# WP Plugin FLAG ICON CSS

**This plugin works with the PHP Version 7.4.16 and more. It has been rewritten and slightly modified to work with PHP Version 7.4.16 and more up PHP Version 8.0.3**


A quick and dirty plugin to integrate flags and language version if you have a single WP distribution per language. You can manage the CSS flag and the URL.

*The plugin integrates a collection of all country flags in SVG — plus the CSS for easier integration from [https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css)*

The integration was made for the photograph Johann Rousselot. Check [http://www.johann-rousselot.com/](http://www.johann-rousselot.com/)
