# A CheckNews WordPress Plugin
Tackling the fact-checking issue and the truth's relative notion in media is skating on thin ice. It is a very dodgy but necessary questioning nowadays.

Just a quick WordPress Plugin based on the request that was made to me, how  to add a ClaimReview structured data element in an article.

As I was focusing on how to understand and explain to developers the "Fact Check" documentation.

- [Fact Check from Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/factcheck)
- [Testing tool for ClaimReview Structured Data](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool)
