# WP Plugin CSS Social Media Buttons

A quick and dirty plugin to integrate your link and social icons. You can manage the css icon and the URL.

*The plugin integrates a set of 48 social media buttons that can be added with just one HTML element, and come in two types (normal and flat) and in four styles (square, rounded, round, bordered). The icons are vector images meaning the buttons are scalable and retina proof. [https://github.com/timhuisman/css-social-media-buttons](https://github.com/timhuisman/css-social-media-buttons)*

The integration was made for my website. Check [http://www.flaven.net](http://www.flaven.net)
